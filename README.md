# PyTorch Stable Diffusion

This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of the Stable Diffusion model from scratch.

## Getting Started

To use the Stable Diffusion model, follow these steps:

### Download Weights and Tokenizer Files

1. Download `vocab.json` and `merges.txt` from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5/tree/main/tokenizer) and save them in the `data` folder.
2. Download `v1-5-pruned-emaonly.ckpt` from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5/tree/main) and save it in the `data` folder.

### Tested Fine-tuned Models

You can also use pre-fine-tuned models with the Stable Diffusion.

1. **InkPunk Diffusion:** Download the checkpoint file from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/Envvi/Inkpunk-Diffusion/tree/main).
2. **Illustration Diffusion (Hollie Mengert):** Download the checkpoint file from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/ogkalu/Illustration-Diffusion/tree/main).

## How to Use

Once you have downloaded the required files, you can start using the Stable Diffusion model for your projects.

Feel free to explore and experiment with different fine-tuned models for various applications!
